## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the Starbridge Platform, please follow these guidelines:

### **üîí Private Disclosure**

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@starbridge-platform` (or create a private issue if email is not available)
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Your contact information
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

### **üìã Information to Include**

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Component affected** (which deployment module)
- **Vulnerability type** (privilege escalation, information disclosure, etc.)
- **Attack vector** (network, local, etc.)
- **Prerequisites** for exploitation
- **Kubernetes version** and environment details
- **Proof of concept** (if safe to share)

### **‚è∞ Response Timeline**

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity
  - **Critical**: 1-7 days
  - **High**: 1-4 weeks
  - **Medium**: 1-3 months
  - **Low**: Next major release

### **üéñÔ∏è Recognition**

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our platform:

- **Security Hall of Fame** (if we implement one)
- **Public acknowledgment** in CHANGELOG (with your permission)
- **Coordinated disclosure** timing that works for both parties

## üîê Security Best Practices

### **For Contributors:**

- **Never commit secrets** or credentials
- **Use secure defaults** in all configurations
- **Follow least privilege principle** in RBAC configurations
- **Validate input** in shell scripts and configurations
- **Use official container images** where possible

### **For Users:**

- **Change default passwords** immediately
- **Use strong, unique passwords** for all services
- **Enable RBAC** in production environments
- **Regular security updates** of Kubernetes and container images
- **Network segmentation** between environments
- **Monitor access logs** and audit trails

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

The Starbridge Platform includes several security features:

### **Authentication & Authorization:**
- **Guardian Nexus (Keycloak)** for centralized authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control** with predefined roles
- **Multi-factor authentication** support (configurable)
- **Session management** and timeout controls

### **Network Security:**
- **Namespace isolation** between environments
- **Network policies** for traffic control (configurable)
- **TLS encryption** for service communication
- **Ingress controls** with security headers

### **Secrets Management:**
- **Kubernetes secrets** for sensitive data
- **SSH key management** for File Bridge services
- **Database credentials** properly secured
- **No hardcoded secrets** in configurations

### **Monitoring & Auditing:**
- **Access logging** in all services
- **Audit trails** for administrative actions
- **Security event monitoring** capabilities
- **Health check endpoints** for security monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Security Considerations

### **Default Configurations:**
- Default passwords are used for demonstration
- **MUST be changed** in production environments
- Some security features may be disabled in dev mode

### **File Bridge Services:**
- SSH access requires proper key management
- File permissions should be carefully configured
- Local file system access needs proper isolation

### **Database Access:**
- PostgreSQL instances need network security
- Database credentials should be rotated regularly
- Backup security should be considered

## üöÄ Security Roadmap

Future security enhancements may include:

- **Automated vulnerability scanning** integration
- **Security policy templates** for different environments
- **Enhanced audit logging** and SIEM integration
- **Zero-trust networking** configurations
- **Automated secret rotation** capabilities
