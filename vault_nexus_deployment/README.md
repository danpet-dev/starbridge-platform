# 🔐 Vault Nexus - Advanced Secret Management

## 🌟 Overview

Vault Nexus provides enterprise-grade secret management for Starbridge Platform using HashiCorp Vault. This is an **optional enhancement** that significantly improves security posture and Trivy scan results.

## 🎯 Security Benefits

### **Trivy Scanner Improvements:**
- ✅ **Eliminates hardcoded secrets** in YAML manifests
- ✅ **Dynamic secret injection** prevents static analysis findings
- ✅ **Encrypted secret storage** reduces attack surface
- ✅ **Audit trails** improve compliance scoring

### **Enterprise Features:**
- 🔄 **Automatic secret rotation**
- 🔐 **Encryption at rest and in transit**
- 📊 **Detailed access logging and auditing**
- 🎖️ **Fine-grained access policies**
- 🔄 **Secret versioning and rollback**

## 📋 Deployment Modes

### **Mode 1: Standard (Current)**
```yaml
# Uses Kubernetes Secrets
secretSource: kubernetes
complexity: low
security: good
maintenance: minimal
```

### **Mode 2: Vault Enhanced** 
```yaml
# Uses Vault for secrets with K8s integration
secretSource: vault
complexity: medium
security: excellent
maintenance: moderate
```

### **Mode 3: Vault Enterprise**
```yaml
# Full Vault integration with OIDC
secretSource: vault-enterprise
complexity: high
security: maximum
maintenance: high
```

## 🚀 Quick Start (Vault Enhanced Mode)

### **1. Deploy Vault Nexus**
```bash
make deploy-vault-nexus MODE=enhanced
```

### **2. Initialize Vault**
```bash
make vault-init
make vault-unseal
```

### **3. Configure Kubernetes Integration**
```bash
make vault-k8s-setup
```

### **4. Deploy Services with Vault**
```bash
make deploy-postgres MODE=prod VAULT=enabled
make deploy-n8n MODE=prod VAULT=enabled
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Vault Policies**
```hcl
# Database secrets policy
path "database/data/postgres/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# n8n secrets policy  
path "workflow/data/n8n/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Guardian Nexus secrets
path "security/data/keycloak/*" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

### **Kubernetes Service Account Integration**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: vault-auth
  annotations:
    vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject: "true"
    vault.hashicorp.com/role: "starbridge-platform"
```

## 📊 Security Comparison
