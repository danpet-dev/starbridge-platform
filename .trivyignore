# Infrastructure-related acceptable risks
CVE-2023-5678  # Example: Low severity issue in base Alpine image
CVE-2024-1234  # Example: Medium severity in OpenSSH (required for SFTP)

# File Bridge specific exceptions
# SFTP containers need some elevated privileges for file operations
CIS-1.3.1      # File Bridge containers need root for SFTP server setup
CIS-1.5.1      # SSH host key generation requires some privileges

# PostgreSQL specific exceptions  
CVE-2023-9999  # Example: Acceptable PostgreSQL CVE for our use case

# Nginx/Alpine acceptable risks
CIS-4.1        # Nginx configuration follows security best practices
LOW-001        # Low severity findings in web server configuration

# Development vs Production exceptions
# These only apply to development deployments
DEV-IGNORE-001 # Development mode containers have relaxed security
